### Built With

- axios
- jwt-decode
- react
- react-router-dom

## Thoughts 

- Versus installing react-icons -> I just used a unicode character.  
- Doing this without axios seems much more difficult and probably more error prone.  
- I could use more practice with axios and some of its advanced features.
- I didn't add a disable react-dev-tools package.  
- Strict Mode prevents the users list from displaying.
